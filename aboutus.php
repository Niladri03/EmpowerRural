    <p>In many countryside communities all over the world, people really want to improve their lives and make things better. But it's not easy because in these areas, they don't have access to important services and chances to succeed, like people do in the cities. Even though technology is making things better for many people, it's still hard for folks in rural areas to get connected and have better lives. In response to this digital divide, we present "Empower Rural," a groundbreaking project that seeks to bridge this gap and empower rural communities through a network of Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) operating from Common Service Centres(CSC). 
A Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) is an individual who is responsible for providing government and non-government services to citizens in rural areas of India. CSCs are equipped with computers, printers, and other IT equipment that allows VLEs to provide a wide range of services, including:
<br>•	Aadhaar card registration and updation
<br>•	E-governance services such as filing of taxes, applying for government schemes, and accessing social security benefits
<br>•	Financial services such as bank account opening, microfinance, and insurance
<br>•	E-commerce services such as bill payments
<br>•	Education and training services
<br>Such services play an important role in bridging the digital divide in rural India. They provide access to essential services that would otherwise be difficult to rural residents. They also help to promote entrepreneurship and economic development in rural areas. 
<br>In conclusion, the creation of Empower Rural is a bold step taken by the Indian government to bridge the digital divide between rural and urban areas. They are playing a crucial role in bringing digital services to the doorsteps of rural India, empowering the rural population and fostering entrepreneurship. Despite the challenges face, they are contributing to the development of rural areas and helping to create new job opportunities.
